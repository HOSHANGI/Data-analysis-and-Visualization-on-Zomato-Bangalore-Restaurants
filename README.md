Data Analysis and Visualization on Zomato-Bangalore-Restaurants
May 2023 - Present

The Zomato-Bangalore-Restaurants project focuses on analyzing the factors that impact the aggregate rating of restaurants in Bangalore. With over 12,000 restaurants in the city offering a variety of cuisines, it is essential to understand the dynamics of the restaurant industry and identify the key drivers of success.

In Bangalore, where the demand for restaurant food is continuously growing, both established and new restaurants face challenges in standing out and attracting customers. This project aims to uncover insights into the restaurant industry by studying factors such as the type of establishment, location, and popularity of different cuisines.

The project's objectives include:

*Analyzing the Zomato dataset to understand the factors influencing restaurant ratings in Bangalore.
*Exploring the diversity of restaurant types and their distribution across different areas of the city.
*Examining the preferences for vegetarian and non-vegetarian food in different localities and identifying any correlations with specific demographic groups.
*Conducting sentiment analysis to gauge customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.
*Visualizing the data through charts, graphs, and maps to present findings in an intuitive and accessible manner.
*Providing actionable insights and recommendations to restaurant owners and stakeholders for enhancing their offerings and customer experience.
*This project leverages data analysis and visualization techniques to gain comprehensive insights into the Bangalore restaurant scene. By understanding the factors that contribute to success, restaurant owners can make informed decisions and cater to the preferences of their target audience.

Tools and Technologies:

*Python for data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.
*Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and statistical calculations.
*Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
*Jupyter Notebook for coding and documentation.
*Statistical analysis techniques for exploring relationships and patterns in the data.

Through this project, we aim to provide valuable insights to the restaurant industry in Bangalore, enabling them to make data-driven decisions and enhance their competitiveness in the market.
